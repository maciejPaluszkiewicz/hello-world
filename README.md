Hello Pirates - talk like a pirate day:

Avast ye filthy land lubbers! Prepare to be boarded!
Well met, jim lad. We be pirates, savvy?
Yarr, harr, and a bottle of rum! 
Ahoy there, Cap'n Tightpants!
Ye'll have to kill me before me dies.
With your head on my shoulders we'd wreck civilization.
What will ye do with a drunken pirate, ear-lie in the morning.
I be a pir *hic*. I be a pir *hic*. I be a pir *hic*. I shteal things.
Sit down on the deck, mate! Rough seas ahead.
Thank the gods I'm not a landlubber.
Why is the rum gone?
